Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the https://hy-motion.ai website (the "Service") operated by hy-motion.ai ("us," "we," or "our").

### 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.

### 2. The Service

hy-motion.ai provides a user interface to access the **hy-motion** artificial intelligence model for generating images, artwork, and visual assets ("Generations") based on text prompts entered by the user.

The Service operates on a **Credit System**. Actions within the Service, such as generating an image, upscaling, or variations, require the consumption of virtual credits ("Credits"). The Service is offered through a free trial tier with limited Credits and various paid subscription tiers ("Paid Tiers") that provide an allocation of Credits.

### 3. User Accounts

To access certain features of the Service, you must create an account. You are responsible for safeguarding your password and for all activities that occur under your account. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

### 4. User Content and Ownership

*   **Your Prompts:** You retain all rights to the text prompts you input into the Service.
*   **Your Generations:** Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you own the rights to the images you generate using the Service (the "Generations"). You grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, and display your Generations solely for the purpose of providing the Service (e.g., displaying in your history).
*   **Public Gallery:** Unless you are subscribed to a "Pro" or "Ultra" plan with "Private Mode" enabled, your Generations may be viewable publicly in the Service's community gallery.

### 5. Fees, Payment, and Refunds

*   **Paid Tiers:** Access to additional Credits and features requires a subscription. All fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars.
*   **Billing:** We use a third-party payment processor (e.g., Stripe) to bill you through a payment account linked to your account.
*   **Automatic Renewal:** Subscriptions will automatically renew for the same period unless you cancel your subscription through your account settings before the end of the current billing period.
*   **7-Day Money-Back Guarantee (Refund Policy):**
    We want you to be completely satisfied with our Service. We offer a **7-day no-questions-asked money-back guarantee** on your initial subscription purchase. If you are not satisfied with the Service, you may request a full refund within 7 calendar days of your initial purchase by contacting us.
    *   *Note:* This refund policy applies to the first charge of a subscription only. Renewal charges are generally non-refundable unless required by law, but you may cancel anytime to prevent future charges.

### 6. Credit Usage Policy

*   **Consumption:** Credits are deducted from your account balance at the time a request is made to our AI models (e.g., clicking "Generate"). The cost per action (e.g., 1 Credit per image) is displayed on the interface.
*   **Expiration:**
    *   **Subscription Credits:** Credits granted as part of a monthly subscription reset at the beginning of each billing cycle. Unused subscription credits do not rollover to the next month unless explicitly stated in your plan features.
    *   **Top-up Credits:** Credits purchased as one-time "Top-up Packs" do not expire as long as your account remains active.
*   **No Cash Value:** Credits have no monetary value and cannot be transferred to other users or redeemed for cash.

### 7. Acceptable Use Policy

You agree not to use the Service to:

*   Generate content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassment, defamatory, obscene, or hateful.
*   **Child Safety:** Generate or upload Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). We have a zero-tolerance policy and will report such activities to authorities.
*   **Deepfakes:** Generate realistic images of real people (public figures or private individuals) without their consent for the purpose of deception, harassment, or defamation.
*   Attempt to reverse-engineer the Service or use automated systems (bots) to scrape data or bypass Credit limits.

### 8. Termination

We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. You may terminate your account at any time by contacting us or through your account settings.

### 9. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE AI GENERATIONS WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE ENTIRELY UNIQUE.

IN NO EVENT SHALL hy-motion.ai, ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, OR PARTNERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE.
