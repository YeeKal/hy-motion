Welcome to **HY-Motion.ai**, the premier online gateway to experience the next generation of generative 3D animation. We are dedicated to making state-of-the-art motion synthesis accessible to game developers, indie animators, and digital artists—eliminating the need for expensive motion capture suits, studio rentals, or complex manual rigging.

### 🚀 Powered by HY-Motion 1.0

At the core of our platform lies **HY-Motion 1.0**, a groundbreaking open-source model developed by the **Tencent Hunyuan Team**. It represents a significant leap forward in the field of computer vision and kinematics.

Unlike video generation models that output flat pixels, HY-Motion utilizes a massive **1 Billion Parameter Diffusion Transformer (DiT)** architecture to generate **mathematical skeletal data (BVH/SMPL)**. This means the output is true 3D data that can be rotated, retargeted, and applied to any character mesh in your game engine.

#### Key Capabilities of the Model

*   **⚡ Skeleton-Based Generation:** We don't make videos; we make assets. The output is 3D rotational data compatible with standard animation pipelines.
*   **🧠 Deep Instruction Following:** Thanks to its 1B parameters, the model understands complex, multi-stage prompts (e.g., *"A ninja runs forward, jumps over an obstacle, and lands in a crouch"*).
*   **🎮 Physics-Based Realism:** Trained on over 3,000 hours of high-quality motion data, HY-Motion minimizes "foot sliding" and maintains realistic weight distribution compared to older generation models.
*   **⏱️ Rapid Inference:** Through our optimized cloud infrastructure, generating a complex 10-second animation takes just seconds.

### 💡 Why Use HY-Motion.ai?

While the HY-Motion model is open-source, running a 1B parameter 3D generation model locally requires enterprise-grade GPUs, complex Python environments, and heavy dependencies. **HY-Motion.ai solves this.**

We provide a seamless, cloud-based wrapper that allows you to:

1.  **Zero Setup:** No Python, no Conda, no Drivers. Just open your browser and type.
2.  **Game-Ready Exports (Pro):** Raw BVH files are hard to use. We are building an automated pipeline to convert motions into **standard FBX files** compatible with **Unity Humanoid** and **Unreal Engine 5 (Manny/Quinn)**.
3.  **Cloud Asset Library:** Never lose a generation. Save your history and organize animations into project folders.
4.  **Privacy Focus:** Your prompts and generated assets are secure.

### 🗺️ Our Roadmap

We are currently in our **Beta (MVP)** phase. We are actively building features to support the indie game development ecosystem:

*   **Phase 1 (Current):** Instant text-to-motion generation, web-based 3D skeleton preview, and raw BVH downloads.
*   **Phase 2 (Upcoming):** User accounts, generation history, and "Motion Library" management.
*   **Phase 3 (Pro Tools):** Launch of the **Auto-Retargeting Engine**—one-click export to FBX for Mixamo, Unity, and Unreal.
*   **Phase 4 (API):** Developer API access for studios to integrate motion generation directly into their tools (e.g., Blender plugins).
