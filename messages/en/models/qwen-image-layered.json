            {
                "question": "Does it work on real photos or just AI images?",
                "answer": "It works on both. Whether it's a Midjourney creation or a photo from your camera, Qwen analyzes the pixel data to decompose the scene structurally."

                "question": "Can I use this for professional video editing?",
                "answer": "Yes. The 'Parallax' use case is very popular. Because it generates a clean background plate behind the foreground, you can pull the layers apart in 3D space without seeing artifacts or holes."
            },
            {
                "question": "What resolution does it support?",
                "answer": "Currently, it supports standard generation resolutions (up to 1024x1024 native), but we include an upscaler to ensure the final layers are crisp enough for web and video use."
            },
            {
                "question": "How accurate is the 'Inpainting' behind the object?",
                "answer": "It is context-aware. If you remove a person standing in front of a brick wall, it continues the brick pattern. For highly complex or chaotic backgrounds, minor manual touch-ups might still be needed."
            },
            {
                "question": "Is it better than Photoshop's 'Remove Tool'?",
                "answer": "It is faster for the specific task of 'Separation'. Photoshop requires you to mask the object first, then use Generative Fill on the background. Qwen does the masking, extraction, and filling all at once."
            },
            {
                "question": "Can I separate specific parts, like just the hat?",
                "answer": "Qwen generally separates by semantic depth (Fore/Mid/Back). For very specific granular control (e.g., separating a hat from a head), you might need to run the 'Foreground' layer through the tool a second time."
            },
            {
                "question": "Does it cost credits?",
                "answer": "Yes, generating a layered decomposition consumes credits similar to generating a new image, as it requires significant GPU processing to hallucinate the occluded areas."
