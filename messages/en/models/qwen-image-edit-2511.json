      {
        "question": "What is Qwen Image Edit (2511)?",
        "answer": "Qwen Image Edit (2511) is Alibaba’s latest open-source AI image editing model. It builds on the original Qwen-Image model and adds powerful editing capabilities with a focus on consistency, accuracy, and support for multiple subjects."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is it different from Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 or other editors?",
        "answer": "Compared to v2509, version 2511 delivers much stronger multi-person consistency (fewer identity swaps), integrated community style (LoRA) support, and better handling of product or industrial edits. It also shows improved geometric reasoning for structured edits."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can it remove or add people in a photo without errors?",
        "answer": "Yes. The model is trained to edit group images carefully. For example, you can add a person to the left of the frame or remove someone, and it will adjust background and shadows accordingly while keeping everyone else intact."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does Qwen Image Edit (2511) support text editing in images?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. You can include text instructions like \"replace the sign text with 'Open 24/7'\" in Chinese or English, and the model will render the new text with correct font style and alignment, often without spelling mistakes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What built-in styles or filters does it have?",
        "answer": "It comes with popular community LoRA filters embedded. This means you can invoke styles (like specific lighting effects or artistic looks) directly by name or prompt without extra setup, expanding creative possibilities out-of-the-box."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it suitable for product design or advertising?",
        "answer": "Yes. Its enhanced structural awareness makes it ideal for product visuals and design mockups. For instance, marketers can update packaging or backgrounds while the model maintains straight edges, reflections, and labels accurately."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I get the best results?",
        "answer": "Use clear, natural prompts and constrain edits one step at a time. Provide reference images for consistent style or subject identity. For text edits, specify the exact string. If needed, iterate: review the output and tweak the prompt for refinement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does using Qwen Image Edit (2511) cost more credits?",
        "answer": "Yes, it is a large 20B model and may consume more compute. On z-image.app it costs approximately double the credits of a standard model, but it often succeeds without retries, saving time and effort."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many input images can I use?",
        "answer": "You can upload up to 3 images: typically one main image to edit and up to two reference images. These references help guide the edit (for example, to match a style or a specific object) while the main image is modified."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I try Qwen Image Edit (2511)?",
        "answer": "It’s integrated on z-image.app’s playground. Simply select it from the model dropdown. It’s also available for developers via Hugging Face or Alibaba’s API for custom integration."
