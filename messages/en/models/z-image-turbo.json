                "question": "Can Z-Image Turbo really write text in images?",
                "answer": "Yes. One of its standout features is the ability to accurately render text. It supports both English and Chinese characters effectively, making it superior to many older models for generating signs, posters, and logos."
            },
            {
                "question": "How fast is the generation?",
                "answer": "Z-Image Turbo uses an 8-step inference process. On our platform, this translates to generation times often under 1 second, depending on server load, making it significantly faster than standard diffusion models."
            },
            {
                "question": "Is it free to use on z-image.app?",
                "answer": "Every registered user gets 10 free credits per month, which you can use to try Z-Image Turbo. Since it is highly efficient, it consumes fewer credits per generation compared to heavier models available on our Pro plan."

            },
            {
                "question": "What is the best way to write prompts for it?",
                "answer": "Z-Image Turbo responds well to natural language. For text rendering, enclose the text you want to appear in single quotes (e.g., 'a neon sign saying \"Open\"'). It also handles bilingual prompts mixed with English and Chinese."
            },
            {
                "question": "How does it compare to SDXL or Midjourney?",
                "answer": "Z-Image Turbo focuses on speed and text accuracy. While Midjourney may have a specific artistic style, Z-Image Turbo is faster and offers more control over text rendering and bilingual support, making it more practical for commercial workflows."
