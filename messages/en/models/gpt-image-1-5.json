GPT Image 1.5, however, wins on **control**. If you need specific text spelled correctly, a strict UI layout, or the ability to edit a background without changing the character's face, GPT Image 1.5 is the superior tool."
            },
            {
                "question": "Can it really spell text correctly?",
                "answer": "Yes, significantly better than previous generations. By placing text in double quotes (e.g., \"Summer Sale\"), the model treats the letters as structural shapes rather than textures, resulting in high legibility for headings, signs, and logos."
            },
            {
                "question": "Is it suitable for photorealistic images?",
                "answer": "Absolutely. While it defaults to a clean, commercial look, you can prompt for 'imperfect, grainy 35mm photography' to get realistic results. However, for 'accidental' or 'candid' realism, Nano Banana Pro might still have a slight edge in texture."
            },
            {
                "question": "How does the 'Edit' feature work?",
                "answer": "GPT Image 1.5 supports conversational editing. Once an image is generated, you can simply type a follow-up command like 'Make it snowing' or 'Change the car to red'. The model understands which parts of the image to keep stable and which to alter."

            {
                "question": "Does it support reference images?",
                "answer": "Yes. You can upload an image to use as a style reference or a composition guide. This is particularly powerful when combined with text prompts to strictly control the output."
