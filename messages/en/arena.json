                "answer": "The Arena allows you to select up to 4 different AI models (like Z-Image Turbo, Flux.2, or Nano Banana Pro) and run the same prompt across all of them simultaneously. This helps you directly compare generation speed, artistic style, and image fidelity to decide which model best fits your needs."

            {
                "question": "How are credits calculated for each comparison?",
                "answer": "Different models consume different amounts of GPU resources, so their credit costs vary. For example, the highly efficient Z-Image Turbo costs only 1 credit, while heavier models like Nano Banana Pro may cost 30 credits per image. The total cost of a generation is the sum of the credit costs of all selected models."

            },
            {
                "question": "What happens if I run out of credits?",
                "answer": "To continue using premium models or running multi-model comparisons, you will need to top up your credits. We offer 'Basic' and 'Pro' subscription plans. Upgrading not only refills your credit balance but also grants you priority queue access for faster generations."
            },
            {
                "question": "What is the difference between the Basic and Pro plans?",
                "answer": "The Basic plan is designed for casual explorers, giving you enough credits to run daily comparisons on standard models. The Pro plan is for power users, offering a much larger credit allowance suitable for high-cost models (like Nano Banana Pro) and heavy batch processing."
            },
            {
                "question": "Can I compare just two models instead of four?",
                "answer": "Yes, you have full control. You can select anywhere from 1 to 4 models for your battle. Selecting fewer models will consume fewer credits per run."
            },
            {
                "question": "Why is Z-Image Turbo the default model?",
                "answer": "We feature Z-Image Turbo as the benchmark because of its incredible balance of speed (8 steps) and cost-efficiency (1 credit). It serves as a perfect baseline to see how much 'bang for your buck' you get compared to more expensive models."
            },
            {
                "question": "Do unused credits roll over to the next month?",
                "answer": "This depends on your specific subscription tier terms. generally, subscription credits refresh monthly. Please check the pricing page for the specific terms regarding credit rollover for Basic and Pro plans."
