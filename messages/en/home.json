  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "What is HY-Motion and how does it work?",
        "answer": "HY-Motion 1.0 is a cutting-edge text-to-3D animation model developed by Tencent. Simply type a description of an action and it generates a corresponding human skeletal animation. Its billion-parameter transformer understands complex prompts (like combat moves or sports actions) and produces smooth, realistic 3D motion."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is hy-motion.ai free to use?",
        "answer": "Yes! We offer a free online playground demo. You only need an account to try it out. The demo has limited daily runs and a basic output resolution. Our Pro version (coming soon) will remove limits, add high-res exports and priority processing for power users."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to create an account to use it?",
        "answer": "No login is required for the free demo. You can start generating animations right away. Signing up for a free account will let you save animations and access more runs, but basic use doesn’t need any sign-in."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of animations can I create with text?",
        "answer": "You can generate a wide range of human motions: walking, running, jumping, fighting, dancing, and more. The model knows 200+ action categories (including sports, combat, daily activities) and can chain multiple steps (e.g. \"pick up object, wave, then sit\"). Prompt in plain English or Chinese for best results."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I use the animations in my projects?",
        "answer": "After generation, you can download the animation in standard 3D formats (FBX, BVH, GLTF). The service automatically retargets motions to a neutral skeleton, making them easy to import into Unity, Unreal, Blender or other 3D tools. From there you can apply your own character rig."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the generated motions realistic?",
        "answer": "Yes. HY-Motion is trained on thousands of hours of motion data and fine-tuned with physics constraints. This means animations have natural weight shifts, no foot sliding, and accurate timing. In tests it produces much more lifelike motion than older demo models."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use the animations for commercial projects?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. HY-Motion 1.0 is released under Tencent’s open-source license (Apache 2.0). You own the animations you create on our platform and can use them in games, films, or products without restrictions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What languages are supported for text prompts?",
        "answer": "The model is trained on both English and Chinese data, so it handles prompts in either language. You can write simple or complex instructions in Chinese or English, and HY-Motion will generate the corresponding motion sequence."
      },
            {
        "question": "Does it support facial expressions or finger movement?",
        "answer": "Currently, HY-Motion 1.0 focuses on full-body kinematics (Body Pose). It generates excellent gross motor movements (running, dancing, fighting) but does not yet support detailed facial blendshapes or intricate finger articulation."
      },
            {
        "question": "Can I use the output in Unity or Unreal Engine?",
        "answer": "Yes. While the raw model outputs academic formats (BVH/SMPL), our platform offers a 'Pro' conversion layer. We automatically retarget the skeleton to match the standard Unity Humanoid or UE5 Mannequin rigs, so you can drag and drop the files into your game engine."
