  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "What is HY-Motion and how does it work?",
        "answer": "HY-Motion 1.0 is an advanced text-to-3D motion generation model developed by Tencent. Simply type a description of an action and the model generates a corresponding full-body skeletal animation. It uses a billion-parameter transformer trained on diverse motion data to produce smooth, realistic character motion from natural language prompts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is hy-motion.ai free to use?",
        "answer": "Yes! We offer a free online playground demo. You can start generating animations with a free account using limited credits. The demo provides basic output quality and daily credit limits. Upgrade to a paid plan to unlock higher credit allowances, priority access, and higher-resolution exports."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to create an account to use it?",
        "answer": "Yes, login is required for the free demo. You can begin generating animations immediately. Creating an account allows you to save and manage your generated motions and access more credits and features."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of animations can I create with text?",
        "answer": "You can generate a wide range of human motions, including walking, running, jumping, dancing, combat actions, and more. HY-Motion understands over 200 motion categories and can chain multiple actions in sequence, e.g., 'walk forward, wave, then jump.' Prompts can be written in English or Chinese for best results."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I use the animations in my projects?",
        "answer": "After generation, animations can be downloaded in standard 3D formats such as FBX, BVH, and GLTF. Our platform also offers automatic retargeting to neutral skeletons or common engine rigs, making import into tools like Unity, Unreal Engine, and Blender seamless."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the generated motions realistic?",
        "answer": "Yes. HY-Motion is trained on thousands of hours of motion data and optimized with physical constraints, resulting in animations with natural timing, balanced weight shifts, and minimal artifacts like foot sliding. The output motion quality is significantly improved compared to earlier models."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use the animations for commercial projects?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. HY-Motion 1.0 is released under Tencent’s open-source Apache 2.0 license, allowing you to use, modify, and distribute animations generated on our platform for personal or commercial projects without restriction."
      },
      {
        "question": "What languages are supported for text prompts?",
        "answer": "The model is trained on both English and Chinese text data, allowing it to interpret prompts written in either language. You can describe your desired motion in simple or complex instructions in either language."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does it support facial expressions or finger movement?",
        "answer": "Currently, HY-Motion 1.0 focuses on generating full-body skeletal motion and gross motor movements such as walking, running, dancing, and combat. It does not yet support detailed facial expressions or intricate finger articulation in its generated animations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use the output in Unity or Unreal Engine?",
        "answer": "Yes. While the raw HY-Motion outputs standard motion formats, our platform provides a 'Pro' conversion workflow that automatically retargets animations to common engine rigs like Unity Humanoid or Unreal Engine 5 Mannequin. This allows you to use the files directly in game engines with minimal setup."
