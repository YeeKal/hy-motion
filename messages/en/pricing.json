                "question": "How do credits work for motion generation?",
                "answer": "Our system is credit-based. Typically, generating a standard **5-second motion costs 10 credits**. Longer or higher-quality generations may cost more. Your monthly credit allowance resets at the start of each billing cycle."
            },
            {
                "question": "What is the difference between the Free and Paid plans?",
                "answer": "The **Free plan** is for testing and personal use; assets are public and cannot be used commercially. **Paid plans (Creator & Pro)** unlock the **Commercial License**, **Private Mode** (hidden from gallery), and significantly faster generation speeds."
            },
            {
                "question": "Can I use the FBX files in my commercial game?",
                "answer": "Yes! If you are subscribed to the **Creator (Basic)** or **Pro Studio** plan, you own the assets you generate. You can freely use them in commercial games, VFX projects, or advertisements without paying royalties."
            },
            {
                "question": "Does unused credit roll over to the next month?",
                "answer": "Currently, monthly credits do not roll over. They reset on your billing date. However, if you purchase separate 'Top-Up Packs', those credits never expire."
            },
            {
                "question": "What software are the files compatible with?",
                "answer": "We export standard `.fbx` animation files. They are compatible with industry-standard tools like **Blender, Unity, Unreal Engine 5, Maya, and Cinema 4D**. The skeletons are optimized for easy retargeting."

            },
            {
                "question": "Do you offer refunds?",
                "answer": "We generally do not offer refunds for partial months or used credits due to the high GPU costs involved in generation. However, if you encounter technical issues, please contact support."
            },

                "question": "What is 'Private Mode'?",
                "answer": "By default, all generations are displayed in the community gallery to inspire others. **Private Mode** (available on paid plans) ensures your generations are only visible to you, protecting your unique game mechanics or story ideas."
