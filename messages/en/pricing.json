                "answer": "Z-Image Turbo is a next-generation text-to-image model developed by the Tongyi team. Its main differentiator is the 'Turbo' technology (distillation), which allows it to generate high-quality images in just 8 steps. This makes it significantly faster than traditional models like SDXL or Flux while maintaining exceptional image fidelity."

            {
                "question": "How are credits used for images?",
                "answer": "With Z-Image Turbo, generating one image costs exactly <strong>1 credit</strong>. Future models or complex editing tasks may have different credit costs, which will be clearly displayed."
            },
            {
                "question": "Does the model support Chinese prompts?",
                "answer": "Absolutely. This is one of Z-Image's 'Killer Features'. Unlike Midjourney or Flux which are optimized for English, Z-Image is natively trained on a vast corpus of bilingual data, offering superior understanding of Chinese prompts, idioms, and cultural contexts."

                "question": "Can I use the images I create for commercial purposes?",
                "answer": "Yes! All images created under our Basic and Pro plans come with a full commercial license, meaning you can use them in marketing, advertising, products, and more. Images created on the Free plan are for personal use only."

                "question": "Why do I see a verification challenge (Turnstile) when generating?",
                "answer": "Since Z-Image Turbo is extremely fast and popular, we use Cloudflare Turnstile to protect our GPU resources from automated bots and DDoS attacks. This ensures that real human users like you get the fastest possible generation experience."
